--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to the extent necessary to
    make, use, sell, sell for importation, have made, and have imported
    any and all aspects of its Contributions and/or the Contributor
    Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on License Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This Section 2.3 shall not apply to any claims of a Contributor if such
Contributor explicitly states that it is acting on behalf of a receiver
of the Covered Software in connection with Covered Software received
from such a receiver.

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor is legally entitled to
grant the licenses set forth in this Section 2.

If You are an individual and a Contributor to Covered Software, you
represent that you have decided to include Your contribution under the
terms of this License.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License,
and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to
alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under the terms of this
License or under other terms of Your choice, provided that You also
comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software.
If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work
governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, the amount of Covered
Software in such Larger Work, plus any rights reserved by relevant
Copyright Holders, is merely to facilitate compliance with the Secondary
Licenses and does not cause the terms of this License to apply to the
other parts of the Larger Work.

4. Compliance
--------------

4.1. The Responsibility of each Contributor

Each Contributor of Covered Software is responsible for claims and
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its obligations under
this License and the warranties, disclaimers, or other liabilities
asserted by such Contributor regarding its Contributions.

4.2. Managing Liability

As a condition to exercising the rights and obligations under this
License, each Contributor hereby assumes responsibility for, and each
Recipient expressly agrees to, manage the Covered Software received
under this License in a way that both:

(a) conforms with the valid legal requirements of every jurisdiction in
    which the Recipient operates; and

(b) does not violate or fail to comply with the obligations,
    restrictions, covenants, or representations stated in any
    Contribution Covered Software or by contractual arrangement between
    You and such Contributor.

5. No Warranty
--------------

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER AN "AS-IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, FREEDOM FROM DEFECTS OR ERRORS, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THIS
LIMITATION SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
IS NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

6. Limitation of Liability
---------------------------

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
LOST PROFITS OR OTHER DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF SUCH
CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This limitation shall not apply to claims of personal injury or death
that result from such party's negligence or to the extent a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that such party is entitled to damages.

7. Trigger
----------

If You initiate litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Covered
Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the
patent licenses granted to You under Section 2.1 shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

8. Additional Terms
--------------------

8.1. If You receive Covered Software under this License while You are
subject to the terms of the AGPL or any other copyleft license, You may
choose to take advantage of the exception in Section 13.
