#### RDAIO-L

### TUI based media player for windows and *nix OS. 

Main idea create modern, console-friendly media player for using in terminal 
It should be simple but support most of common features for popular media-players

####### Usage:

##### Controls:

 [Up/Down] Select 
 
 [P] Play 
 [Z] Pause/Resume  
 [S] Stop  

 [F] Folder  

    DOS-like file selector. Currently you can add single file or directory with files (by pressing L on directory)

 [C] Clear (current track list)
 [Q] Quit 



Track list mode Title's (id3 based)
